5	Despite of instructions shared well in advance restaurant ignored and instead sent more pathetic packing and food was all slipped plus 50% of the portion was oil. Also there was no difference in lunch and dinner contents and was absolutely the same. Paneer veg contained 50% of oil and potato-pea veg was absolutely same in lunch as well as in dinner which means food was cooked in the morning itself. I trusted Kansar due to taste and quality but this time I had been let down by them

5	test is best
1	good food 
3	not even deserve one star
1	I am from Hyderabad. I don't know why the biryani looks like a paste here in surat. In most of the restaurants it is like a kichidi. In Bombay cha tadka.. it is okay...not so bad. but still it can be better. Taste wise it is good .but the spiceness of the dish is diluted by the more fried onions. Fried onions should be used a top garnish not in the dum masala. who will like the sweet biryani.
3	I ordered almost 300+ rs. they didn't given a piece lemon and onion. the taste is too salty
2	We order 500 instead of this the quantity is less
5	The taste was good but the chicken was not fully cooked. 
2	Please do ensure you serve appropriate quantity of chicken. As per our 2 orders observance there is only 2 small bone piece served in each ordered. 
5	Delicious food and great experience with restaurant
4	can increase quantity for rate however taste is good
3	homely taste and the food made my day.. Typical Maharashtrian spicy tastey food..

5	I don't like to say but i had very bad experience with this one. what mrp they're showing and at what price we're getting is two different things for them i think. i don't do business thing but i atleast know that the price we pay for any purchases we can only pay maximum retail price not more than that.
5	Bhot khrab trst hai i thik ice cream bidg gyi hai
5	Your price 40 rupees n pay 60 why
2	Very small portion. 
5	product ke mrp 40rs print ha aur zomato pe 60 rs me sale ho raha ha 
5	ok
1	rate packet 40rs on box he frude say 70ml
5	Price and quantity so poor
2	mrp is 40 still they are changing 60+ delivery charges<br/>not satisfied with hotels dishonesty
5	Hiked prices are mentioned on the zomato and mrp is different. Zomato is also useless for the same.

1	cottage cheese chilly not dry
5	One of my personal favourite restaurant I have ever visit.<br/>We ordered veg manchurian from here. <br/>I think they provide the best quality food in affordable rates. The taste and quality was outstanding. Delivery was fast with maintaining proper packaging.
4	Last evening we ordered Schezwan cottage cheese... which was really fantastic in taste also the quantity was excellent. Talking about delivery it was on time with proper packaging.
5	The Hazelnut Latte was awesome as usual. Added sugar is not needed for either the Hazelnut Latter or Caramel Latte. If you need Caramel in any of your drinks we can request them to add caramel and it just enhance the taste of all their coffees. 
1	bahut hi swadisht
1	this hotel item are only waste of money

1	Not marriot quality<br/>It was not to the standard<br/>The bread was dry and it lacked crispness 
5	Taste was good but lack of information leads to disappointment. It should must have been mentioned that does it contain mil or not. If they can't add this much then atleast send milk sachets.
